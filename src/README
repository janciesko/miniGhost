Based from Mantevo, January 5, 2014. 
Modified to allow progress in over-decomposition strategy in the absence
of MPI support for doing so: source and target must match, but tags static.
Answer will therefore presumably not be correct, but computation and communication
patters will be representative. Therefore application of boundary conditions are turned off.

Integration with proposed MPI FinePoints functionality added March 2018.
